To begin first you'll need to have node installed https://nodejs.org/en/. Make sure it's at least the same major version as specified in the .node_version file within the project folder.

Then run:

```sh
npm install
```

Once all the packages are installed then run:

```sh
npm run start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the application running.

A server will also start on http://localhost:8000
